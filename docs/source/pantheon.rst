Pantheon
========

The Pantheon is an integral part of any D&D. The faith, the power, and the dominion of religion on any city, any people or the whole region lays the foundation to any good adventure. And I absolutely do not have the time to create a well-balanced pantheon. So I take the easy way out.

The Gods
--------

We will use the deities from the world of Exandria which feature in Critical Role. We will adopt the Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods and the Lesser Deities will be homebrewed or taken from other sources like the Forgotten Realms.

The Devils
----------

We will use the Nine Hells of Baator from the Forgotten Realms. The Devils are from this domain and the Archdevils that rule each layer will be based on the Forgotten Realms. Some interesting modifications might be done like the location of Tiamat, the imprisonment of the Betrayer Gods, etc.

The Demons
----------

We will use the Abyss from the Forgotten Realms to house the Demons.

The Feywild
-----------

The Feywild will be a source of mystery in my games. Small glimpses of the Feywild might be provided based on context but no information on this plane of reality will be given. However, this should not deter players from playing a Warlock with an Archfey patron. The powers might originate from the Feywild but the players will have limited information.

Other Patrons
-------------

For the Warlock class, the patron lives at the heart of the character. Your patron can be a fiend, an archfey, a celestial or an entity from a plane of existence long forgotten by the world. Feel free to build your warlock and we will discuss your patron based on potential homebrew or choosing from the vast world of the Forgotten Realms and Exandria.
