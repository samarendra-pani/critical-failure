Political Landscape
-------------------

The Council of the Five
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Council of the Five are the five ministers who govern the city under the guidance of the Lord of the City. The Council of the Five are:

* The Pillar of War - Commands military forces, oversees defense, and ensures the realm's strength in battle.
* The Pillar of Wealth - Controls trade, taxation, and the treasury, maintaining economic stability.
* The Pillar of Law - Upholds justice, legal matters, and internal order, acting as the kingdom's arbiter.
* The Pillar of Faith - Represents religious orders, divine guidance, and the spiritual well-being of the people.
* The Pillar of Secrets - Oversees espionage, hidden knowledge, and external threats lurking beyond the kingdom's sight.

They are the leaders of the Society of Myrrah. They are ones responsible for electing the Lords of the City, either electing from within themselves or externally. The people holding the title of a Pillar are also changed by the other Pillars.

Lord Lionel Dieter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Built like the mountain halls his ancestors once carved, Lionel Dieter is a dwarf of unshakable presence.
His thick, silver beard is meticulously braided, each strand woven with gold rings bearing the symbols of his lineage.
Deep-set amber eyes, sharp as a jeweler's blade, peer out from beneath thick brows, always watchful, always weighing.
His skin is rough and weathered, the mark of a ruler who has spent as much time in the forge and battlefield as in the council chambers.
He wears a suit of dark steel plate, its pauldrons engraved with dwarven runes of endurance.

A proud and shrewd dwarven ruler, Lionel Dieter is as unyielding as the stone halls his ancestors carved.
He is a pragmatic leader who relies on his council to manage the city's affairs, but he remains the final authority.
His deep voice carries the weight of law, and his hammer—Oathbinder—has sealed more treaties than it has crushed skulls.

Lord-General Kaelis Vaelor, the Pillar of War
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Kaelis is a towering goliath with a weathered face marked by old scars, the most prominent running from his temple to his jaw.
His raven-black hair is cut short, and his storm-gray eyes seem to scan every room for threats.
He wears a suit of burnished plate armor, often draped in a deep crimson cloak, the sigil of Myrrah's military proudly displayed.
His calloused hands rarely stray from the hilt of his longsword.

A veteran warrior and strategic mastermind, Kaelis commands Myrrah's military forces. 
Once a decorated knight, his loyalty to Lord Dieter is unquestionable, though he secretly believes the city's defenses are stretched too thin.
He pushes for military expansion, fearing that unseen forces conspire against Myrrah.

Mistress Veyna Calder, the Pillar of Wealth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tall and slender, Veyna is an orcv who carries herself with effortless grace.
Her piercing emerald eyes always assessing, always calculating.
Her long auburn hair is kept in elaborate braids, adorned with golden rings and jewels—subtle reminders of her wealth.
She dresses in flowing silks embroidered with intricate patterns, always favoring deep purples and greens.
Her voice is smooth and persuasive, carrying the weight of a thousand shrewd deals.

A cunning orc with an eye for profit, Veyna controls Myrrah's trade, taxation, and treasury.
Ruthless in negotiation and pragmatic in policy, she has greatly built the city's wealth.
She was not always trained in the art of handling wealth.
She was raised in the courts and learnt how to handle the nobility in their whims and desires.
She went to various cities and refined her art and trained herself to be as independent as possible.


High Justiciar Aldric Varrow, the Pillar of Law
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Aldric is a severe-looking halfling in his late fifties, his face lined with the weight of decades of judgment.
His steely blue eyes are unwavering, and his short, graying hair is kept meticulously combed.
He wears the black and silver robes of the judiciary, each thread woven with enchantments to resist tampering or deception.
A sword, more ceremonial than practical, rests at his side, but it is his gaze that truly cuts through falsehoods.

Aldric is the unbending force of justice in Myrrah.
He greatly believes in the place of law in civil society and works to stay true to the spirit of the law.
But being a judge comes with grey decisions and many of these decisions breeds enemies.
He upholds the principles that the city is supposed to live by and has in many instances voiced his opinion against the other Pillars.
Knowing that law is as alive as the city it governs, he tries to learn with the changing times and adapt the laws while keeping the spirit of the law alive.

High Priestess Seraphine Duskwhisper, the Pillar of Faith
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Seraphine possesses an otherworldly beauty, her dusky complexion glowing faintly in candlelight.
Her silver-white hair cascades down her back, and her golden eyes hold an unsettling wisdom beyond her years. 
She wears flowing robes of ivory and sapphire, a red phoenix embroidered on her robes, the symbol of the Serenrae.

A human cleric of dual ancestry — her mother an aasimar, her father a mortal — Seraphine is a devout follower of Serenrae.
Her place as the Pillar of Faith is a surprise to many as the main deities of the cities are Pelor, Bahamut and Erathis.
But the worshippers of the Holy Sanctum hold Serenrae in the highest regards and agree that Seraphine's connection to the Upper Planes is undeniable and she has the grace of the gods.
She understands her role as a guide to the elder priests of the other deities and ensures that harmony is maintained.

Lord Marius Velcroft, the Pillar of Secrets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Marius is a ghost among the living, his pale complexion and gaunt frame giving him the appearance of a man half-consumed by the shadows he serves.
His dark, shoulder-length hair is often unkempt, and his sharp hazel eyes gleam with unsettling knowledge.
He dresses in muted, unremarkable clothing, allowing him to blend into any crowd.
When he speaks, his voice is quiet yet commanding, each word measured and laced with hidden intent.

A shadowy figure whose presence is more rumor than certainty, Marius is the master of spies and hidden knowledge.
Not much is known about him to people outside the Council, but his network of informants is vast and far-reaching.
He has informants in every corner of the city, from nobles' courts to the lowest taverns.
He rarely speaks in council meetings, but when he does, his words carry the weight of unspoken truths.
