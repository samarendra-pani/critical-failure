Welcome to Critical Failure's Wiki!
===================================

This server initially hosted an idea for a campaign. It was a grand plan that never came to fruition because I was overenthusiastic. But now I will start again and I start small. Welcome to Critical Failure.

The adventures of this game will take place in and around the city of Myrrah, a well-to-do city with a happy population and many travellers. The adventurers, who may choose to originate from the city or be an outsider, will face many challenges to prove themselves to be worthy of the coin or reputation they have been promised. They might work for the local authorities or for the various guilds that bring life to the city. They might work to help themselves or help others.

The adventure is not set in stone. All of our adventures will happen in the backdrop of this city but your set of adventurers can change. Based on what we want to play, we will be the knights in shining armour or the team of assassins sent to kill the lord of the castle.

Believing in the fun after Nat1s, I create this Wiki for all players who are unlucky enough to have me as a DM. May our critical failures bring a smile to all at the table!
