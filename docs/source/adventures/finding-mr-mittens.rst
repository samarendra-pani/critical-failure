Finding Mr Mittens
==================

During a lovely early morning stroll through the town outskirts, disaster strikes! Right from Madame Goblet's frail old arms, Mr Mittens is abducted by a mysterious bat-like creature.
Mr Mittens was supposed to be the star attraction at the upcoming Cat Festival and the mascot for the Trippy Tails Tavern.
The poor old lady is heartbroken and pleads for your help. Will you be able to find Mr Mittens and bring him back to Madame Goblet?

In return, she promises to reward you with the secret recipe for her famous apple pie.

Character Background
--------------------

I will prefer if the characters know each other beforehand. You are local heros in the town of Mewth, a small town known for its love of cats.

Since this a one-shot and we will be focusing more on the adventure than the character-building, pre-establishing character relationships will help us get into the game faster.


Basics on Mewth
---------------

Mewth is a small town located at the edge of a forest. Cats roam freely in this town and are extremely loved by the townsfolk. 
In this town of feline adoration, rumors exist of a Cat King who watches over the town's cats and blesses them with nine lives. He is rumored to live in the giant oak tree in the centre of the forest.
Every year, the townsfolk celebrate the Cat King and his feline subjects with a grand festival, where the town's cats are dressed in elaborate costumes and parade through the streets.

Only few days are left to the festival, and Mr Mittens, the star attraction, has been kidnapped. The town is in distress, and the fate of the festival hangs in the balance.
