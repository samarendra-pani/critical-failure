Premise
-------

Long centuries have passed since the Calamity, and the world has moved beyond the shadow of the Betrayer Gods.
Their names, once whispered in fear, have faded into myth and legend, remembered only in tales shared by firelight.

In the city of Myrrah, peace and prosperity mark the New Age.
Yet, unease stirs in the nearby Rune Castle.
Reports of the surrounding forest withering and dying have reached the city, and the sea carries lifeless fish to the castle's shores, painting a grim picture of decay.

Rune Castle, home to the Runekeeper family, stands at the heart of this growing mystery.
The Runekeepers, once rulers of the region, were stripped of power with the rise of the Dawnlight Kingdom.
They abandoned their political ambitions and retreated into quiet isolation, their once-proud lineage becoming little more than a footnote in history.
Now, even the sparse contact maintained with the family has been severed.

Efforts to investigate the castle have met with failure.
A formidable barrier surrounds the estate, impervious to ordinary means of entry.
Scholars and mages who studied the phenomenon report the presence of an ancient and malevolent force unseen since the Calamityâ€”the unmistakable touch of the Crawling King.

Faced with this looming threat, the city's leaders have resolved to act.
A band of skilled adventurers has been called forth, tasked with breaching the castle's defenses, uncovering its dark secrets, and confronting the evil that festers within.
The fate of Myrrah, and perhaps the world, may depend on their courage and resolve.

Character Creation Rules
------------------------

* Level 16 (Multiclassing allowed).
* Standard Array or Point Buy.
* Besides Feats gained from ASI, two additional feats can be taken.
* Only PHB 2024 material - classes, species, feats, etc.
* Wonderous items list - 3 uncommon items, and 2 rare items (from DMG 2024).
* Starting gold - 5000 gp.

Character Background
--------------------

I will prefer if the players discuss beforehand how their characters know each other since they will all be based out of Myrrah and are a team. The city's elite will be recruiting you as a group of well-established adventurers.

Since this a one-shot and we will be focusing more on the adventure than the character-building, pre-establishing character relationships will help us get into the game faster.
